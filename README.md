## Usage:
* You can always use [demo page]()
* Or you can copy this repository and set you birth date in main.js/user_date object(change year, month, day), then you will need to rebuild the project(`npm install && gulp build`)
* Also you can download generated .html file and host it anywhere you like
* Off course you can print pages and mark lived days by yourself

## ToDo:
* Todos in code
* optimize loading
